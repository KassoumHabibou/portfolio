              The Center for Studies and Research on International Development (CERDI) was established since 1976. It was the first joint research unit, between the  [National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS)](https://www.cnrs.fr/en) and a French university dedicated to development economics. CERDI mainly brings together economists, researchers from CNRS, IRD, and teaching researchers from the [University Clermont Auvergne](https://www.uca.fr/en). Their areas of expertise are varied and cover both microeconomic and macroeconomic aspects of development. Research conducted at CERDI focuses on the study of international development processes, its drivers, and its economic, social, and environmental consequences. They revolve around three main axes: development finance, sustainable development trajectories, and the integration of developing countries into the global economy.

              * the empirical evidence (e.g., growth and inequality, industrial revolution, the role of institutions, etc.).
            - Advanced Econometrics:  
              * resampling methods (e.g., monte carlo experiments, bootstrap, permutation tests, etc.);
              * nonparametric econometrics (e.g., density estimation, finite mixture models, etc.);

              * human capital (nutrition, education, health, etc.);
              * financial capital (microfinance and micro-savings, access to credit, etc.);
              * physical capital (property rights and technology adoption, etc.).
          # For over 20 years, AMSE has consistently ranked among the top five most productive research centers in economics in France. The ETE track of the Economics master's program, which lasts for one year, is a research-oriented track that prepares students to pursue doctoral studies. It offers advanced training in **economics** and **research methodology** allowing students to specialize through a wide range of courses in specific areas of economics.
          # It is a sub-regional education institution that welcomes around fifteen nationalities and is listed among the most recognized institutions for training statistician in Africa. As a member of the *Observatoire Economique et Statistique d'Afrique Subsaharienne* ([AFRISTAT](https://www.afristat.org/)) and affiliated with the *Institut National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques* ([INSEE](https://www.insee.fr/fr/accueil)), ENSAE welcomes technician and engineer students from across all Africa, as well as visiting professors from prominent European universities. Under the guidance of a pedagogical team composed of academics and professionals, the future graduate of ENSAE assimilates, throughout their course, **statistical** and **economic theories** as well as the necessary skills for their operational application.
