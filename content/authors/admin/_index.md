Helloüëã

<p align="right">
I am a Ph.D. candidate in **Development Economics** at the University of Clermont Auvergne and a **Data Scientist** from the √âcole Nationale de la Statistique et de l‚ÄôAnalyse de l‚ÄôInformation (ENSAI-Rennes).
<p> 
<p align="right">
I am particularly interested in nutrition and health issues in developing countries, with a special focus on using machine learning techniques to address these challenges. My favorite letter in the alphabet is <i class="fab fa-r-project" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#035AA6"></i> and my favorite animal is <i class="fab fa-python" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#035AA6"></i> (I actually only swear by these two tools!). I strongly believe in the power of open science, which is why I have made the replication codes for some of my projects available on my [Github](https://github.com/KassoumHabibou) account. In my free time, I enjoy playing football, running and learning new skills online.
